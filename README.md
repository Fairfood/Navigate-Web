# FAIRFOOD Navigate

**Navigate Documentation**

## Overview

Naviagate is a platform designed to monitor key areas like deforestation and
living income. Users can switch between these categories to track and analyze
data for each. The platform provides insights and tools to help manage and
address environmental, economic, and social challenges effectively.

### Map

The satellite map report feature enables users to track value ranges across
different regions using visual indicators like colors or symbols. It helps
to highlight variations in data, making it easier to identify patterns and
trends on the map. This tool offers a clear and intuitive way to analyze
geographic data for better decision-making.

### Assessment section

The assessment section within each pillar delivers the evaluation values,
offering a detailed insight into the performance or status of each component.
This section helps users understand specific metrics and their implications
for comprehensive analysis.

### Deforestation assessment

This section offers a deforestation assessment based on data analysis of
multiple areas using satellite imagery. It evaluates key factors such as
tree cover extent and primary forest loss. The impact matrix highlights
non-acceptable outcomes across several indicators, including total tree
area lost, deforestation event frequency, and share, indicating critical
environmental issues in the analyzed regions.

### Living income assessment

This section provides a living income assessment, focusing on the
socio-economic conditions of a country with a significant agricultural
workforce. It highlights the gap between current payments and the required
living income price for agricultural production. The analysis shows a
substantial price gap, indicating that workers are being paid less than
what is necessary to achieve a sustainable living income.

### Summary section

The summary section consolidates key evaluation values from each pillar,
providing an overview of overall performance. It highlights critical
metrics and their implications, offering a concise and comprehensive
snapshot for effective analysis and decision-making.

### Deforestation Summary

This section provides an overview of how to assess deforestation risks.
It follows specific standards such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)
and Rainforest Alliance guidelines. Measures tree cover loss within a
113-meter radius around farms and monitors protected areas within a 2-kilometer
proximity. Key indicators include the total area of tree cover loss, the
number of events leading to deforestation, and losses in protected areas.
These assessments help identify the impact across various certification schemes
like Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade, and EUDR.

### Living income assessment

This section presents a demographic and agricultural overview of Honduras.
It highlights the country’s population distribution, with a significant
portion engaged in agriculture, which contributes notably to the GDP. Key
metrics include the number of agricultural cooperatives, the total and average
farm plot sizes, and the gender distribution of farmers. It also reviews
essential financial indicators like living income prices, production costs,
and yield rates. Farmers are categorized based on economic performance, with
groups defined by income, production costs, and productivity levels.

### Intervention sections

To improve farmers’ outcomes, suggested interventions include training in
sustainable farming practices, access to better seeds and tools, and
enhanced irrigation techniques. Supporting cooperative structures can boost
bargaining power, while providing financial literacy programs and microloans
will empower farmers economically. Additionally, promoting agroforestry and
crop diversification can enhance resilience to climate change and market
fluctuations.

## Supported Features and best practices

- Users can select impact areas on a map by adjusting filters for supply chain,
  country, and batch.
- This allows flexibility in viewing impacts across different segments of the
  value chain.
- In the Living Income category, users can choose to display values as either
  the mean or median.
- This feature enables more tailored and precise data analysis.
